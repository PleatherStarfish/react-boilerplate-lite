## Why?
The whole React community knows and will unanimously agree that [react-boilerplate](https://github.com/react-boilerplate/react-boilerplate) is the ultimate starter template for kickstarting a React project. It's setup with all the industry best practices and standards. But it also has a lot more than what you just need to start a react-redux app. I found myself always having to strip out the same parts to use the boilerplate so I decided to create a `lite` version. 

## Features Stripped Out
- Intl - All files and libaries for Intl support


## Quick start
1. Clone this repo using `git clone https://github.com/ljmerza/react-boilerplate-lite.git`
2. Move to the appropriate directory: `cd react-boilerplate-lite`.<br />
3. Run `yarn` or `npm install` to install dependencies.<br />
4. Run `npm start` to see the example app at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Info
These are the things I stripped out from [react-boilerplate](https://github.com/react-boilerplate/react-boilerplate) - _github project rules, ngrok tunneling, shjs, service worker, webpack dll plugin, i18n, styled-components, code generators and a few more._
